    "# The MS COCO classification challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Razmig Kéchichian\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook defines the multi-label classification challenge on the [MS COCO dataset](https://cocodataset.org/). It defines the problem, sets the rules of organization and presents tools you are provided with to accomplish the challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Each image has **several** categories of objects to predict, hence the difference compared to the classification problem we have seen on the CIFAR10 dataset where each image belonged to a **single** category, therefore the network loss function and prediction mechanism (only highest output probability) were defined taking this constraint into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "We adapted the MS COCO dataset for the requirements of this challenge by, among other things, reducing the number of images and their dimensions to facilitate processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the companion `ms-coco.zip` compressed directory you will find two sub-directories:\n",
    "- `images`: which contains the images in train (65k) and test (~5k) subsets,\n",
    "- `labels`: which lists labels for each of the images in the train subset only.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each label file gives a list of class IDs that correspond to the class index in the following tuple:"

Comparative study of networks and analysis of results is of particular importance for grading. Please refer to course organization slides for the details of grading.\n",
